## Challenges:

> As a student, and having zero background in computer science + I'm not a programmer, I'm a designer ðŸ˜…. You will definitely feel lost at first. Specially on our first session of "Javascript", you will have this kind of expression "what the heck I am doing". But hey, "We're living in the modern world, lots of resources to back-up our zero knowledge, the only solution if you'll put an effort into it and just keep going ("Grit")..

## What do I have to learn more, in terms of Javascript:

> * Algorithms (reference)
> * and more....
